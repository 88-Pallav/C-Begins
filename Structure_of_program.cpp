/* 
*KEYWORDS: * Reserved for specific functionality cannot be redefined or overloaded.
- C++ has 90 
- Java has 50 
- C has 32 
- Python has 33 
- More the keywords, more the complexity of language but not all are frequently used.

Indentifiers are created by programmers. Eg. cin, cout, endl main(), #include
Operators are +, *, /, << (Insertion Operator), >> (Extraction Operator), :: (Scope Resolution), "", {}, ;

- All this together is syntax of a program

*Pre-processor: * A program that processes your source code before compiler sees it.
It first strips all comments from source code and replaces each comment with a single space.
Then it looks for pre-proceessor fdirectives and then executes them. 

*Pre-processor Directives: * Lines in the source code which start from '#'. Eg.
#include, When it sees this it replaces it with file is it refering to and then recursively
processes the file.
Pre-processor are used to conditionally compile code.

Note: Pre-processor doent understand C++. It simply follows the pre-processor directives
and gets the source code ready for compiler. Compiler does understand pre-processor.
